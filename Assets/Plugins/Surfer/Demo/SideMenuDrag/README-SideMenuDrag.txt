Because Surfer State names are based on GUID created the moment you import Surfer, the scene must be setup in 2 steps before it can work.

1)Canvas->SideMenuToLeft->SUElementCanvas : State : “choose the state you want from the list”

2)Canvas->SideMenuToUp->SUElementCanvas : State : “choose the state you want from the list”

Hit play, drag the white boxes and see the panels in action.
